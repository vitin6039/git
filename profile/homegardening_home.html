<h2>Welcome to Let's Get Dirty</h2>

<p>Welcome to Let's Get Dirty a family friendly website where we advocate for local gardening in many different forms including conventional ways as well as <a title="Aquaponics" href="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/?page_id=7">Aquaphonics</a> and others.</p>

I am starting the site this spring 2011 after 3 years of trial and fail gardening. I have learn some lessons but by no measure considered my self an expert on anything. The way I planed this blog is that I will journal my progress every 1st and 15th of the month or a two weeks basics format. I will post pictures of everything from progress to pests and other problems that may arise.

I also have other useful information for gardeners or anyone interested in sustainable sources of food. I have a page on <a title="Aquaponics" href="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/?page_id=7">Aquaponics </a>'a passion of mine', backyard beekeeping something I am looking forward to be part of and worn composting. I will be adding pages as time goes by.

I am in the process of opening a twitter feed for other to participate and be part of this movement. Thank you again and welcome, now Let's Get Dirty!</p>

<h4><strong>Healthy Choice</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Eating more fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the most important things you and your family can do to stay healthy. When they’re growing in your backyard, you won’t be able to resist them, and their vitamin content will be at their highest levels as you bite into them straight from the garden. Parents, take note: A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that preschool children who were almost always served homegrown produce were more than twice as likely to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day—and to like them more—than kids who rarely or never ate homegrown produce.</p>

<p>With recalls on peanut butter, spinach, tomatoes and more, many people are concerned about food safety in our global food marketplace. When you responsibly grow your own food, you don't have to worry about contamination that may occur at the farm, manufacturing plant, or transportation process. This means that when the whole world is avoiding tomatoes, for example, you don't have to go without—you can trust that your food is safe and healthy to eat.</p>

<h4><strong>Save Money</strong></h4>

<p>Your grocery bill will shrink as you begin to stock your pantry with fresh produce from your backyard. A packet of seeds can cost less than a dollar, and if you buy heirloom, non-hybrid species, you can save the seeds from the best producers, dry them, and use them next year. If you learn to dry, can, or otherwise preserve your summer or fall harvest, you’ll be able to feed yourself even when the growing season is over.</p>

<p>The price of the plant, fertilizer, water, and an occasional bug deterrent is much less than buying at the market. At any price, the market cannot compete with the flavor of homegrown produce, which comes immediately from the plant to the dinner table.</p>
<h4>The potential economic benefits of home gardening, which should be considered in designing garden projects and included in project evaluations, include the following:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Returns from land and labor are often higher than those from field agriculture.</li>
	<li>Gardening gives dual benefits of food provision and income generation.</li>
	<li>Gardens provide fodder for household animals and supplies for other household needs (handicrafts, fuelwood, furniture, baskets, etc.).</li>
	<li>Household processing of garden fruits and vegetables (drying, canning) increases their market value and ensures year-round supply.</li>
	<li>Low-input, low-cost gardening has few “barriers to entry”.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
<h4><strong>Environmental</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Backyard gardening helps the planet in many ways. If you grow your food organically, without pesticides and herbicides, you’ll spare the earth the burden of unnecessary air and water pollution, for example. You’ll also reduce the use of fossil fuels and the resulting pollution that comes from the transport of fresh produce from all over the world (in planes and refrigerated trucks) to your supermarket. <a href="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/plant.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="plant" alt="" src="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/plant.jpg" width="250" height="150" /></a>Crops are usually cultivated as a monocrop - a single species all planted at the same time - in order to maximize growth and labor efficiency. This low species diversity increases the risk of loss from disease and pests, which easily multiply and spread under such conditions. Planting the crop at a single time exposes it to loss by drought and bad weather. In contrast to this, a home garden's high species diversity and staggered planting times increase the likelihood that some crops survive. In the Philippines and the Pacific Islands, patches of taro (Colocasia and other related species) grown in gardens ensure that a family has food after a typhoon or tropical cyclone has wiped out other crops. Plants such as the onion family (Allium sp.) and neem tree (Melia azadirach) are planted in gardens to repel pests. Shade and shelter for the home also protect the home garden crops, which is not the case in open fields. The home garden also provides a secure place to process and store crops.</p>

<h4><strong>Just' Plain Fun!</strong></h4>

</ul>
<p>Watching a seed blossom under your care to become food on your and your family’s plates is gratifying. Growing your own food is one of the most purposeful and important things a human can do—it's work that directly helps you thrive, nourish your family, and maintain your health. Caring for your plants and waiting as they blossom and "fruit" before your eyes is an amazing sense of accomplishment! </p>

<a href="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gardening.gif"><img class="alignleft" title="gardening" alt="" src="http://www.homegardeningworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gardening.gif" width="250" height="150" /></a>Even if you don't have big backyard—or any yard for that matter—you can still grow food. Consider container gardening if you have a sunny balcony or patio or an indoor herb garden on a windowsill. You’ll be amazed at how many tomatoes or peppers can grow out of one pot. Or find out if your city has a community garden, where you can tend to your very own plot. Check out<a> CommunityGarden</a> to locate a community garden near you.

<p>If you need more inspiration, read Barbara Kingsolver’s book, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, which chronicles her family's yearlong commitment to feeding themselves. In beautiful prose, she describes how they grew or raised close to everything they ate, and by the end of the year, they didn't want to quit!</p>

<p>Whatever your motivation for breaking ground on your own backyard garden, chances are good that you’ll take pleasure in this new healthy obby, and that your wallet, the environment, your body, and your taste buds will thank you!</p>
